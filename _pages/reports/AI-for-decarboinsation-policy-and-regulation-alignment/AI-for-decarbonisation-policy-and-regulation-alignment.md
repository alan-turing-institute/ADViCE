# Executive Summary

This Research Report explores how the resilience of offshore wind farms could be
reinforced by artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent automation, and what actions
policymakers and industry should take to enhance the cybersecurity of offshore wind. The
findings are the result of a collaborative project between The Alan Turing Institute’s CETaS
and Data-Centric Engineering (DCE) programme, which was funded by the Lloyd’s Register
Foundation.

**Cyberattacks directly or indirectly affecting offshore wind are happening already** with
companies like Enercon, Vestas, Nordex and Deutsche Windtechnik reporting malware and
ransomware attacks. On the day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the cyberattack on ViaSat
satellite communications affected space-based assets engaged for command and control of
Enercon’s wind turbines in Germany, leading to the loss of remote monitoring access to
more than 5,800 wind turbines. With plans to significantly scale offshore wind capacity in
the UK, resilience to similar cyberattacks must be reinforced.

**Some areas in the cyber-physical infrastructure require more attention from a security
perspective because they could lead to cascading damage.** This includes areas where
the grid integrates new and legacy offshore wind infrastructure, the control centre,
intersections with external actors along the offshore wind supply chain and points of
integration with the Internet.

**Harnessing AI and intelligent automation will reinforce the resilience of offshore wind if
swift action is taken** by government and industry. The AI and intelligent automation
applications identified as the most promising in this report were: anomaly-based intrusion
detection systems (IDS), anomaly detection, intrusion protection systems (IPS), and
hardening and predictive maintenance. While AI and intelligent automation could be
introduced to protect access points that result in the most cascading damage, there are
systemic, supply chain and physical risks which also need to be mitigated. There is an
opportunity to integrate systems that enhance security in the design and construction of
offshore wind systems before offshore wind infrastructure projects are completed.

**Bolstering resilience requires a radical overhaul of systems-engineering practices
towards resilience-based engineering and a range of systemic changes** to wind industry
operations, regulation, intelligence sharing and research. Offshore wind design and
engineering choices can explore increasing heterogeneity in systems designs within a wind
fleet, as well as increased network segmentation to prevent cascading damage when one
turbine faces an attack. 

Organisational emergency response plans, cross-border intelligence sharing, and security response protocols are also required.
This report proposes mitigative actions to address the main resilience challenges, which are
summarised in Table 1 within the executive summary. The rationale and promising practice informing these
recommendations are presented in Section 4 of the report.
