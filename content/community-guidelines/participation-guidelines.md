# Contributor Covenant Participation Guidelines

This Participation Guidelines document outlines our expectations for participants within the team as well as this ADViCE online repository. We also provide steps to reporting any concern, uncomfortable situation or unacceptable behaviour by other participants. We are committed to providing a welcoming, collaborative and inspiring experience for all and expect our Particiaption Guidelines to be honoured.

### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a member has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.
Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics (age; disability; gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race; religion or belief; sex; sexual orientation), including participants with any visible or invisible disabilities.


## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

•	Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
•	Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
•	Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
•	Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
•	Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

•	Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
•	Public or private harassment
•	Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
•	Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
•	The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind


## Scope

This Participation Guidelines applies to everyone using this online resource. Specifically, our Participation Guidelines applies to any conduct:
•	in interactions within the team/community maintaining this repo
•	at any team activity, communication or event related to this repo
•	outside the team activity when a team member is representing this project

This Participation Guidelines also applies when an individual is officially representing ADViCE in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed a representative at an online or offline event.


## Enforcement 

Instances of harassing, abusive, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour should be reported to the ADViCE website and Knowledge Base administrators.
Together we strive to foster an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and included.

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Administratos have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
