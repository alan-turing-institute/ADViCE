# Contributor Covenant Participation Guidelines

This Participation Guidelines document outlines our expectations for participants within the team as well as this ADViCE online repository. We also provide steps to reporting any concern, uncomfortable situation or unacceptable behaviour by other participants. We are committed to providing a welcoming, collaborative and inspiring experience for all and expect our Particiaption Guidelines to be honoured.

### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a member has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.
Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics (age; disability; gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race; religion or belief; sex; sexual orientation), including participants with any visible or invisible disabilities.


## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

•	Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
•	Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
•	Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
•	Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
•	Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

•	Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
•	Public or private harassment
•	Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
•	Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
•	The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind


## Scope

This Participation Guidelines applies to everyone using this online resource. Specifically, our Particiaption Guidelines applies to any conduct:
•	in interactions within the team/community maintaining this repo
•	at any team activity, communication or event related to this repo
•	outside the team activity when a team member is representing this project
•	by members outside the team engaging on this GitHub repository.
This Participation Guidelines also applies when an individual is officially representing ADViCE in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed a representative at an online or offline event.


## Enforcement 

Instances of harassing, abusive, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour should be reported to the ADViCE website and Knowledge Base administrators.
All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
Together we strive to foster an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and included.
Admininstrators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective, restorative and action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.


### Enforcement Responsibilities

Administratos have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting Incident

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting Francisco Gomez Medina (email: fgomezmedina@turing.ac.uk) or Gabin Kayumbi (email: gkayumbi@turing.ac.uk).  
To report an issue involving either Francisco or Gabin, please email directly to abudden@turing.ac.uk

In your report please include:
•	Your contact information.
•	Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.
•	Any additional information that may be helpful.
We will respect confidentiality requests all the time for the purpose of protecting individuals who have been harmed.


### Terminology

* Reporter: Person reporting an incident.
* Reportee: Person being reported.

## Report Handling Process

After receiving a report, the person handling the report will review the incident report and follow this process to determine the cause and consequences that violated this Participation Guidelines and take further actions:
The administrators will reach out to the reporter to ask for further information if the submitted report is not complete or needs some additional context. The administrators will also ensure that person impacted or harmed by the reported incident is safe and identify how they can be further supported.
A meeting with the reportee will be scheduled where the person handling the report will discuss four questions:
•	What happened?
•	What were you thinking at the time?
•	Who has been affected by what you have done? In what way?
•	What do you think you need to do to make things right?
When the incident in question inflicted harm on another person, additional questions will be asked on behalf of the person(s) harmed:
•	What did you think when you realized what had happened?
•	What impact has this incident had on you and others?
•	What do you think needs to happen to make things right?
The person handling the report may follow up with reportee or reporter after this discussion with any additional questions to help them reach a resolution.


### Resolutions

Here are examples of possible resolutions to a report. This list is not comprehensive, and any action necessary to reach a fair resolution will be taken as needed. Possible resolutions to an incident include:

•	a private communication from the project manager, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate.
•	an apology to the person harmed or the team as a whole
•	an action plan for the reportee to improve their awareness and correct future behaviours
•	if confirmed by the person reporting, reportee will have no interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Participation Guidelines, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media.
•	not publishing the content that violated the Participation Guidelines, until necessary changes have been made and agreed upon by the person handling the report.
•	An imposed suspension, such as asking reportee to “take a week off” from the GitHub repo or team activity.
•	a stronger warning with consequences for continued behaviour.

The person handling the report will maintain records of all reports so that they may be reviewed if stronger measures are required when repeated violations occur by the same individual as well as to improve our Participation Guidelines for future participation.
Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the person handling the report will contact the reporter and any other affected parties to explain the proposed resolution. They will ask if this resolution is acceptable and must note feedback for the record. However, they are not required to act on this feedback.
The reportee will be contacted via email informing them of the resolution. A final meeting may be conducted if necessary.


### Conflict of Interest

All reports will be kept confidential with details shared only with people involved in report handling. If a person handling the report is linked with the ongoing issue, they will declare their Conflict of Interest and remove themselves from any discussion related to the report handling.
