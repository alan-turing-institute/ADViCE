This community space is for cross-sector collaboration and knowledge sharing.
ADViCE (AI for Decarbonisation Virtual Centre of Excellence) is delivered by a collaborative consortium that includes Digital Catapult, Energy Systems Catapult and The Alan Turing Institute, all of which bring extensive knowledge and delivery experience in technical, business and industry solutions across AI, policy monitoring and analysis. Its aim is to drive cross-sector collaboration and coordination, define key challenges that are tractable to AI solutions, and disseminate information to relevant stakeholders. ADViCE engages with AI and decarbonisation stakeholders across relevant sectors. By facilitating the dissemination of knowledge, it aims to coordinate and foster collaboration on AI innovations with decarbonisation applications.
