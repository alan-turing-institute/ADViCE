Artificial Intelligence for Decarbonisation’s Virtual Centre of Excellence (ADViCE) is aimed at the development of innovative artificial intelligence technologies for decarbonisation applications to support the transition to Net Zero.

As part of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s (DESNZ) Net Zero Innovation Portfolio, the Artificial Intelligence for Decarbonisation Programme has been set up to support and promote the adoption of Artificial Intelligence decarbonisation solutions for industries.

Part of Stream 1 of this larger (AI for Decarbonisation) innovation programme, Artificial Intelligence for Decarbonisation’s Virtual Centre of Excellence (ADViCE) is aimed at the development of innovative artificial intelligence technologies for decarbonisation applications to support the transition to Net Zero. This stream is being delivered by a collaborative consortium including Digital Catapult, Energy Systems Catapult and the Alan Turing Institute.

## Overview
The broader ambition of the centre of excellence is to coordinate and engage with AI and decarbonisation stakeholders across high-emitting sectors. This initiative is designed to foster cross-sector collaboration, define key challenges that are tractable to AI solutions, and disseminate information to relevant stakeholders. By facilitating the dissemination of knowledge, ADVICE aims to coordinate AI innovations efforts directed at decarbonisation applications. 

The virtual centre of excellence will act as the front door for all collaborators, participants and contributors to foster a vital ecosystem which will:

- Disseminate information publicly and to relevant networks
- Identify strategic and priority challenges for AI innovation for decarbonisation
- Provide pathways to leverage private funding
