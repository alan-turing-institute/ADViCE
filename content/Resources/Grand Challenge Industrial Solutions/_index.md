## Enabling Net Zero Infrastructure 
The following organisations are utilising AI to support developing networks and connect renewables. 
* [Continuum Industries]( https://www.continuum.industries/): Their platform utilises AI to accelerate infrastructure planning, identify better network route options, site selection and optioneering for energy infrastructure and grid connections.
* [HData](https://www.hdata.com/): HData a US company use the analysis and comparison of regulatory documents to speed up the interconnection queue, and approvals for renewable connections.
* [CarbonFreed](https://www.carbonfreed.com/): Utilise AI to speed up certification of new wind and solar PV systems by compiling, evaluating and documenting data and information.
* [Energy Networks Association](https://utilityweek.co.uk/ai-platform-to-provide-instant-grid-connection-approvals/): ENA have developed an AI-powered platform designed to streamline the connections process for domestic low-carbon technologies by assessing installer images to verify electrical cut-outs.
* [Enverus]( https://www.enverus.com/blog/successfully-navigating-the-interconnection-queue-with-project-probability/): Help reduce the interconnection challenge and support asset developers by assigning probability scores to estimate likelihoods for projects being connected.
* Pacific Northwest National Laboratory: The US Department of Energy has announced a [$13 million VoltAIc initiative](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/faster-more-informed-environmental-permitting-ai-guided-support) to streamline siting and permitting of critical clean energy infrastructure  by creating an AI-ready searchable database of Policy Act reviews.
  
## Maximising Flexibility in Energy Networks
The following are some organisations that play roles in flexibility services in the UK. 
* [National Electricity System Operator](https://www.neso.energy/what-we-do/systems-operations/what-does-electricity-national-control-centre-do): The National Electricity System Operator (NESO) develop complex forecast models to estimate how much electricity the system needs and utilises the balancing mechanism to buy and procure the right amount of electricity required to balance the system.
* Distribution System Operators: DSOs are responsible for managing the flow of electricity within their local distribution networks. they are emerging from the current Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) who manage the local networks. The main DNOs/DSOs in the UK are Electricity Northwest ([ENW](https://www.enwl.co.uk/future-energy/distribution-system-operation/)), Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks ([SSEN](https://www.ssen.co.uk/about-ssen/dso/)), Scottish Power Energy Networks ([SPEN](https://www.spenergynetworks.co.uk/pages/distribution_system_operator.aspx)), UK Power Networks ([UKPN](https://dso.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/)), Northern Powergrid ([NPG](https://www.northernpowergrid.com/DSO)),  National Grid Electricity Distribution ([NGED](https://www.nationalgrid.co.uk/smarter-networks/flexibility-and-flexible-power)), and Northern Ireland Electricity Networks ([NIEN](https://www.nienetworks.co.uk/home)).
* [Drax](https://energy.drax.com/electric-assets/): A leading power generator who operate Drax ElectriFlex, a demand management scheme, and the demand flexibility service (DFS) for NESO.
* [Centrica Energy Storage](https://www.centrica.com/our-businesses/upstream/centrica-energy-storage-limited-cesplus/): A major player in the UK gas storage market, provides roughly half of the UK's gas storage.
* [Arenko]( https://arenko.group/): Develops and provides software platforms and technologies that enable the advanced optimization and control of flexible energy assets
* [Modo Energy](https://modoenergy.com/): platform that provide research, indices, and forecasts to support battery energy storage revenues.
