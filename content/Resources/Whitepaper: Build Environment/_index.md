[Built Environment: Carbon Re Whitepapers](https://carbonre.com/whitepapers/)

UK based AI for Materials company, Carbon Re have published a series of technical and white papers assessing approaches and recommendations relating to decarbonisation.

- [Three technologies to reduce climate change:  Why cement production between now and 2030 matters to all humanity, and what we can do about it.](https://carbonre.com/three-technologies-to-reduce-climate-change) 

The report outlines some clear routes to reducing CO2 emissions from cement production today, and highlights the 3 technologies that could deliver over 80% of this impact. Our recommendations include:
Cement producers should focus their resources on the three groups of cost saving technologies listed above to gain cost savings and a strategic advantage over their competitors.
Policymakers need to remove barriers to decarbonization of cement resulting from poor regulations and policies, including overhauling the design of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme, mandating low carbon cement procurement for publicly funded projects, and regularly updating standards for cement quality/ performance to reflect new product innovation.
Investors should support the significant commercial opportunities for existing industry players, new entrants and technology providers.

### [Levers of Change](https://carbonre.com/levers-of-change)

This paper dives into how global standards and regulations are changing the game, setting new, greener rules for cement production. Whether it’s global bodies pushing for new eco-friendly standards or the introduction of carbon taxes and trading schemes, the standards and regulatory landscape is exerting enormous pressure on the cement industry.
