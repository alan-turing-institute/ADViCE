The tools include data estimators, datasets, forecasts, asset modelling, cost estimators, etc.
* **[OpenSTEF](https://lfenergy.org/projects/openstef/)** an LF Energy open source machine learning pipeline for short-term load forecasting for energy networks.
* The **openmod initiative** shares a number of open source energy system [modelling tools]( https://wiki.openmod-initiative.org/wiki/Open_Models)
* **[Epftoolbox](https://epftoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** is a python package for generating day ahead electricity price forecasts with two state-of-the-art models.
* **[forecasting tools](https://github.com/openclimatefix/)** from the Open Climate Fix team for PV generation.
