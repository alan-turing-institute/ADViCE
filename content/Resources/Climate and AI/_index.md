There are many other resources concerning the general use of AI for decarbonisation. Below are links to additional resource lists which may be of interest.

## Bezos Earth Fund - AI for Climate and Nature Grand Challenge

The resources can be found [here](https://www.aiforclimateandnature.org/resources/) and relate to the **AI for Climate and Nature Grand Challenge** from the Bezos Earth fund. There will be several rounds of funding and the first will relate to sustainable proteins, power grid optimisation, and biodiversity conservation. 

The resources related to Bezos Earth Fund reports, and other authors on the issues which relate to the challenges. 

## Climate Change AI

[Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/) is a non-profit organisation looking at the intersection of climate change and machine learning. They provide resources including a newsletter, [webinars](https://www.youtube.com/c/ClimateChangeAI), and [tutorials](https://www.climatechange.ai/tutorials?). 

For understanding applications of AI to wider climate change applications, they have an extensive [report](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485128) considering applications from power systems, climate modelling, transportation, and ecology, among others. 


## AI- Driven Net Zero Report - Elevandi Insights Forum

[This report](https://www.pwc.com/sg/en/publications/assets/page/ai-driven-net-zero.pdf) was released following the Elevandi Insights Forum, which took place in November 2023, and delved into AI’s transformative potential. Authored by PwC and Elevandi, this report conveys the key insights gleaned from the panel discussion. The report aims to explore case studies around decarbonisation and climate risk mitigation while offering a clearer comprehension of how AI can accelerate progress toward achieving the net zero agenda. It showcases diverse AI applications across various sectors such as real estate, agriculture, and finance, demonstrating their capabilities in measuring, modelling, and reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, it underscores critical considerations for deploying AI to advance the sustainability agenda.

## Carbon Re reports

UK based AI for Materials company, Carbon Re have published a series of [technical and white papers](https://carbonre.com/whitepapers/) assessing approaches and recommendations relating to decarbonisation. This includes the following reports

* Three technologies to reduce climate change: [This report](https://carbonre.com/three-technologies-to-reduce-climate-change) outlines some clear routes to reducing CO2 emissions from cement production today, and highlights the 3 technologies that could deliver over 80% of this impact.
* Levers of Change: [This paper](https://carbonre.com/levers-of-change) dives into how global standards and regulations are changing the game, setting new, greener rules for cement production. Whether it’s global bodies pushing for new eco-friendly standards or the introduction of carbon taxes and trading schemes, the standards and regulatory landscape is exerting enormous pressure on the cement industry.
* Carbon taxes set to revolutionise cement production: [This reports](https://carbonre.com/carbon-taxes-set-to-revolutionise-cement-production/) considers the role of carbon taxes in cement production. 

Carbon Re Co-Founder Buffy Price spoke at the ADViCE Launch event (December 2023) as part of our panel discussion. You can watch the launch event online [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqzKEXqrUb0).
