There are many other resources concerning the general use of AI for decarbonisation. Below are links to additional resource lists which may be of interest.

## Bezos Earth Fund - AI for Climate and Nature Grand Challenge

The resources can be found [here](https://www.aiforclimateandnature.org/resources/) and relate to the **AI for Climate and Nature Grand Challenge** from the Bezos Earth fund. There will be several rounds of funding and the first will relate to sustainable proteins, power grid optimisation, and biodiversity conservation. 

The resources related to Bezos Earth Fund reports, and other authors on the issues which relate to the challenges. 

## Climate Change AI

[Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/) is a non-profit organisation looking at the intersection of climate change and machine learning. They provide resources including a newsletter, [webinars](https://www.youtube.com/c/ClimateChangeAI), and [tutorials](https://www.climatechange.ai/tutorials?). 

For understanding applications of AI to wider climate change applications, they have an extensive [report](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485128) considering applications from power systems, climate modelling, transportation, and ecology, among others. 


## AI- Driven Net Zero Report - Elevandi Insights Forum

[This report](https://www.pwc.com/sg/en/publications/assets/page/ai-driven-net-zero.pdf) was released following the Elevandi Insights Forum, which took place in November 2023, and delved into AI’s transformative potential. Authored by PwC and Elevandi, this report conveys the key insights gleaned from the panel discussion. The report aims to explore case studies around decarbonisation and climate risk mitigation while offering a clearer comprehension of how AI can accelerate progress toward achieving the net zero agenda. It showcases diverse AI applications across various sectors such as real estate, agriculture, and finance, demonstrating their capabilities in measuring, modelling, and reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, it underscores critical considerations for deploying AI to advance the sustainability agenda.

## Carbon Re reports

UK based AI for Materials company, Carbon Re have published a series of [technical and white papers](https://carbonre.com/whitepapers/) assessing approaches and recommendations relating to decarbonisation. This includes the following reports

* Three technologies to reduce climate change: [This report](https://carbonre.com/three-technologies-to-reduce-climate-change) outlines some clear routes to reducing CO2 emissions from cement production today, and highlights the 3 technologies that could deliver over 80% of this impact.
* Levers of Change: [This paper](https://carbonre.com/levers-of-change) dives into how global standards and regulations are changing the game, setting new, greener rules for cement production. Whether it’s global bodies pushing for new eco-friendly standards or the introduction of carbon taxes and trading schemes, the standards and regulatory landscape is exerting enormous pressure on the cement industry.
* Carbon taxes set to revolutionise cement production: [This reports](https://carbonre.com/carbon-taxes-set-to-revolutionise-cement-production/) considers the role of carbon taxes in cement production. 

Carbon Re Co-Founder Buffy Price spoke at the ADViCE Launch event (December 2023) as part of our panel discussion. You can watch the launch event online [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqzKEXqrUb0).

## Artificial Intelligence for Climate Change Mitigation Roadmap
In November 2024, Innovation for Cool Earth Forum (ICEF) have released [the second edition]( https://www.icef.go.jp/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ICEF-AI-Climate-Roadmap-Second-Edition-2024.pdf) of their AI for Climate Change Mitigation roadmap. The comprehensive report looks at how AI can help cut emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition to providing recommendations, they explore eight sectors in which AI is helping respond to climate change (including power systems, manufacturing and the building sector) and also look at crosscutting issues such as large language models and greenhouse gas emissions from AI. 

## Generative AI for Power Grid Operations – NREL
The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have released [a report]( https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy25osti/91176.pdf ) on generative AI for power grid operations which reviews potential applications

## Department of Energy, AI in Energy Reports 2024
As directed by the US Executive Order 14110, Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, the U.S. Department of Energy, produced [a report on the priority use cases](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/AI%20EO%20Report%20Section%205.2g%28i%29_043024.pdf) have been identified in four broad areas where AI can be immediately deployed to improve the grid. These areas include grid planning, siting and permitting of clean energy infrastructure, grid operations and reliability, and grid resilience. The report also looks at broader areas for AI to support the green energy economy including transport, buildings, manufacturing and industry, and agriculture. 
In addition to the above report, there is a complementary [AI for Energy report]( https://www.anl.gov/ai/reference/ai-for-energy-report-2024) produced by the Argonne National Laboratory looks further ahead at advanced research challenges focusing in five key areas, nuclear, power grid, carbon management, energy storage, and energy materials.
