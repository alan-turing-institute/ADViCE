A major blocker for deploying AI at scale for decarbonisation challenges is ensuring there is enough skills to properly develop, deploy and operate the algorithms safely, optimally and with minimal bias. 

## AI Skills in the Energy Sector - A Survey

There is very little understanding of Data Science Skills in the energy sector. [This short report](https://es.catapult.org.uk/report/data-science-skills-in-the-energy-sector-survey-results/) by Energy Systems Catapult presents results from a survey of a small number of participants to highlight some of the issues in recruitment, and leadership, as well as how AI is being applied.  

The team also followed up with [a blog item](https://es.catapult.org.uk/insight/data-science-skills-in-the-energy-sector-closing-the-gap-elisa-evans/) looking at resources to support developing skills and reducing the skills gap.
