**Zero Carbon Farms of the Future**

*Wednesday 10 April 2024, 10.00-11.30*

In this webinar, we will discuss the transformative potential of AI-driven solutions for optimizing energy usage and enhancing productivity in controlled 
environment agriculture (CEA). From precision climate control to smart lighting systems, AI technologies are reshaping the way we cultivate crops indoors while 
minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact.

This webinar will focus on the intersection between controlled environment agriculture and AI in the drive for decarbonistion. 
Our lineup of expert speakers share their insights and experiences through the following topics: 

- AI-powered energy management systems in CEA. 
- Benefits of leveraging AI for optimizing resource utilization and reducing costs. 
- Real-world applications of AI in energy-efficient farming. 
- Innovations in sensor technology and data analytics for intelligent decision-making. 
- Future trends and opportunities at the intersection of AI and sustainable agriculture.
