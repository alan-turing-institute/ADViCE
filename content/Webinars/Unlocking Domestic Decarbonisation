# Unlocking Domestic Decarbonisation Webinar

The fourth webinar in the ADViCE webinar series focused on the challenge on using AI to support domestic decarbonisation, in particular for decarbonising home heating. This was one of the grand decarbonisation challenges as outlined in the project’s [recent report](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-12/advice-_ai_for_decarbonisation_challenges.pdf). 

## Challenge Overview

This challenge relates to grand challenge 1 (GC1) **Unlocking Domestic Decarbonisation**. Decarbonising homes requires changes to both heating systems and consumer behaviours in every home in the UK. Engaging consumers in that process, financing it, and delivering it at pace are all major challenges

* **Date:** 17th June 2024
* **Talk Description** Without successfully decarbonising homes and domestic transport there is very little chance for successfully meeting the UK’ s Net Zero targets. Residential heating is responsible for more than 13% of greenhouse gas emissions each year . Decarbonising homes requires changes to both heating systems and consumer behaviours in every home in the UK. Engaging consumers in that process, financing it, and delivering it at pace are all major challenges. This webinar presented multiple perspectives on some of the challenges and systemic blockers to decarbonising heating, including, identifying routes and roadmaps for domestic consumers,   designing and planning heating networks, and developing solutions and incentives for the public. It includes insights from those with direct, on-the-ground experience in installing low carbon heating systems, and from organisations applying AI solutions to help decarbonise homes
