# Overview
 
Manufacturing processes are a significant contributor to global GHG emissions, with heavy industry responsible for nearly 40% of global CO2 emissions.

However, the task of decarbonising manufacturing is complex and costly, often requiring a complete overhaul of production processes and finding low-carbon alternatives for feedstocks and raw materials.

Presenting the different decarbonisation challenges that exist in the manufacturing sector, this webinar explores the different artificial intelligence (AI) tools available for decarbonising inputs and processes.

Topics will include the design of low-carbon manufacturing processes, implementation of onsite renewables and storage solutions, as well as carbon accounting and modelling.

**Decarbonising Manufacturing Inputs**

*Monday 20th May 2024, 12.00-13.30*

This webinar will highlight cutting-edge AI startups that have made significant contributions to decarbonising manufacturing inputs. These companies will share insights and case studies for solutions to decarbonise manufacturing processes including:
- Leveraging AI for data analysis and visualisation within supply chains, 
- Carbon tracking and modelling facilitated by AI
- Harnessing AI for the design and optimisation of new manufacturing processes

As part of a panel discussion, AI developers and adopters will explore some of the existing challenges surrounding AI adoption in manufacturing, including finding relevant datasets to fuel AI tools to deciphering the tangible benefits of AI tools for manufacturers.
