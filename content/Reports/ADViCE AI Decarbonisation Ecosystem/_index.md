title: "AI for Decarbonisation Ecosystem Report"
draft: false
---

This report was released at our ADViCE Launch event in December 2023. The Report provides insights into, and an overview of, the AI and decarbonisation R&D and innovation landscape in the UK. It captures key use cases, organisations, projects and trends to inform government and policymakers, academia, industry and investors. 

It sets the foundations for further work in this burgeoning area: identifying gaps and market opportunities that will be the basis
for the remainder of the ADViCE project; providing a set of recommendations for future activity; and looking at future avenues for further investment and growth. This report is part of Stream 1 of the UK Government’s Artificial Intelligence for Decarbonisation programme: establishing an AI for Decarbonisation Virtual Centre of Excellence, also known as ‘ADViCE’. This stream is being delivered by a collaborative consortium that includes Digital Catapult, Energy Systems Catapult and The Alan Turing Institute.
