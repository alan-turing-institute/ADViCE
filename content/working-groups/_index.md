The ADViCE Expert Working Group plays a critical role in bringing together key stakeholders across the UKâ€™s AI for decarbonisation landscape, aligning perspectives from across AI development, government, regulation, decarbonisation innovation and academia.

The group focuses on the key sectors within the ADViCE remit, namely Agriculture, Manufacturing, Energy and Built Environment.

With the ambition to drive the design of interventions and future growth opportunities, the vision for the ADViCE Expert Working Group is to enable the following:

- A collaborative and coordinated voice that will drive further opportunities to enable AI for decarbonisation innovation by bringing together critical knowledge, expertise and leadership across the sectors and applications
- Policy and strategic influence, representing different sector needs and clearly illustrating both opportunities and challenges to government and policymakers to drive further innovation
- Representation, not only in fostering an inclusive approach, but spearheading best practice across the relevant sectors to drive new, inclusive and responsible approaches to AI for decarbonisation.

The group will produce a series of white papers to inform the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). These outputs will be then collated to create a final AI for Decarbonisation intervention roadmap, delivered to DESNZ.

The group will meet once every two months, from April 2024 until March 2025.
