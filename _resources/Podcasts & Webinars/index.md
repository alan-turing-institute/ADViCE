In addition to the webinars which will be created as part of the ADViCE programme (see [here](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/ADViCE/webinars/)) there are other useful talks, podcasts and webinars for AI in decarbonisation which may be of interest:

* **Value in Energy Data Webinars**: [These webinars](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkgx9FDaNeFmONK1-pXyn7p1eX_KnKaDZ) hosted by the Energy Systems Catapult aim to demonstrate the value in data and digitalisation across the energy sector. Although not explicitly focused on AI many of the talks focus directly or indirectly on applications of AI for energy management or decarbonisation.
* **Climate Change AI**: CCAI have their own [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ClimateChangeAI) which focus on uses of AI in climate applications.
* **Hypercube Podcast**: Consulting firm Hypercube have an informative [podcast series](https://wearehypercube.com/podcast/) talking to various experts in the energy sector and regularly talks to those applying AI and data science.
* **INESC TEC** - Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science host a [Power and Energy Webinar series](https://energywebinars.inesctec.pt/) which often includes talks around digital, and AI.
